    <ol>
        <li>First you want to use old rice, typically from a couple days ago that you put in the fridge or the freezer.
            If you don't then making fresh rice is fine but it may not taste as good.</li>
        <li>Next you want to chop and dice the zucchini, onions, and chicken.</li>
        <li>Then crack a couple eggs into a bowl and mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>In a pan add the zucchini and onions to cook them.</li>
        <li>Once the onions become clear and the zucchini has a nice char, add the chicken to cook.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is cooked, create a small circle in the pan to cook the eggs seperately so they don't mix
            with the other ingrediants.</li>
        <li>Once the eggs are cooked, mix them with the other ingrediants and add the rice.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the soy sauce and sesame seeds to taste.</li>
    </ol>
